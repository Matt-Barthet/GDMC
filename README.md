To run the project, visit the GDMC readme for installing and running MCEdit on your computer: https://github.com/mcgreentn/GDMC/wiki
Once in MCEdit, user the filter tool and run the PCG_Village_Filter.

The code for each custom filter can be found in the GDMC/stock-filter directory, and the following files should be present for the implementation to work:
	1) PCG_Village_Filter.py
	2) PreProcessing.py
	3) Agent_Utility.py
	4) AHouse_v5.py (by adrian brightmoore).
